# Self Balancing Car
This is a self-balacing car I built in 2013.I built this robot for the Freescale Cup Smart Car Competition.You can check out my compition video [here](https://youtu.be/HWOfQ2LwfWA).This car runs on two wheels,it uses gyro and accelerometer to detect the tilt angle and uses three PID controller to keep the car balanced,running,and navigating along the race track.

Here are some snapshots of my car.

A detailed article about how I implemented the self-balancing car:

I also modeled the car in Solidworks,you can download the model from my [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/self-balancing-car-1).
